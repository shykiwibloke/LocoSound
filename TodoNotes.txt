This is a series of notes to remind me what I was going to do next

1) Test Debug mode - need a log file output - repurpose -P flag or collapse so -d also specifies file seed (never overwrite logs)
2) Amperage sort of working - gets stuck - determine if motors need wiring reversed so all the same. Does amps work in reverse?
3) Need two volume controls - one for overall engine, one for horn
4) Spread dryer sound over time more
5) Make amp text bigger - think about dumping graphs
6) DONE - Change serial speed to 115200 (raspi)
7) Change serial speed to 19200 (motor controllers)
8) DONE - Change SetFileDataPath away from cmd-line to config file only
9) DONE - Add Baby filePath or hardwire to subdirs for sounds and graphics
10) DONE - If Config file not found in program directory - create one (otherwise user does not know the default values...)
11) Harmonize the addmessageline() and fprintf to stderr calls all over the codebase.
12) Update instructions
