This is a series of notes to remind me what I was going to do next

1)  Fix Config Generate bug that does not create screen height variable
2)  Add Speedo
3)  Write Instruction Manual
4)  Think about adding 'Vigilance!' visual warning to screen, making sound quieter or some other trick to make it audible
5) Remove the old logMessage routine and repoint all the calls
6) Reconnect LowPowerLabs shutdown wiring & Install code for Raspi
7) Autostart locomotive on startup?
