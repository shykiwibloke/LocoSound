This is a series of notes to remind me what I was going to do next

1) DONE- Test Debug mode - need a log file output - repurpose -P flag or collapse so -d also specifies file seed (never overwrite logs)
2) DONE- Amperage sort of working - gets stuck - determine if motors need wiring reversed so all the same. Does amps work in reverse?
3) DONE - Need volume control for overall engine
4) Spread dryer sound over time more - edit sound file directly
5) DONE - Make amp text bigger
6) DONE - Change serial speed to 115200 (raspi)
7) DONE - Change serial speed to 34800 (motor controllers)
8) DONE - Change SetFileDataPath away from cmd-line to config file only
9) DONE - Add Baby filePath or hardwire to subdirs for sounds and graphics
10) DONE - If Config file not found in program directory - create one (otherwise user does not know the default values...)
11) DONE - Harmonize the addmessageline() and fprintf to stderr calls all over the codebase.
12) Update instructions
13) DONE Add 'Starting' mode for prime mover.
14) Fine Tune Engine sound defaults in config file
15) DONE Air Dryer sounds do not turn off when motor restarted.
16) Speedo? - Maybe even use that as an input to dynamic braking?
18) Remove the old logMessage routine and repoint all the calls
